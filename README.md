# Auto Proceed Extension

Marketplace extension link: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ricco6.auto-proceed

Automatically confirms command execution prompts in Antigravity so you don't have to click/press Alt+Enter.
You can still write text while the toggle is ON; meaning leaving it always ON is fine.
